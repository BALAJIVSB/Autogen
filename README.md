# Autogen

1) This notebook "autogen_graph" presents a modular framework for orchestrating collaborative AI agents using the autogen_agentchat library. The code sets up an automated multi-agent system that includes two roles: a Writer agent and a Reviewer agent. These agents are powered by OpenAIâ€™s gpt-4o model, accessed securely via an API key. The Writer generates creative content in response to a user-provided task, while the Reviewer evaluates and provides feedback on the generated content. The interaction between these agents is structured using a directed graph model (DiGraphBuilder), which defines the communication flow from the Writer to the Reviewer. The conversation is executed using the GraphFlow engine, which allows streaming of intermediate outputs. This architecture demonstrates how structured agent collaboration can be used for tasks like creative writing and iterative refinement in AI-powered systems.
